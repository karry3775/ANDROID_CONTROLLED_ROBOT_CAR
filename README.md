# keyboard_control
This is a test file for a tilt_car_project which involves motor control using Sensor data from Android. In this case the values 
are obtained from command line but for my next project the values will be fed real-time from an android sensor!
# tilt_car_project
This is the main file that needs to be run in order to control the motion of the car using mobile tilt data. Currently this works while connected to USB. Next step would be to control it using a bluetooth module so that wireless communication can be established
